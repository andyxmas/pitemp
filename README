This is a project to record temperature using the raspberry pi.

Initially based on this tutorial: 
http://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/overview

Who knows where it will end up...!?


n.b. just doing a little bit of learning about branching about git.
this change to the readme was done to branch test1.
come back to this after a while and 'finished' my changes to README.
