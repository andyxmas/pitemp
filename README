This is a project to record temperature using the raspberry pi.

Initially based on this tutorial: 
http://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/overview

20/7/2013: managed to get this working over cron now.
 - changed the ref to Adafruit_DHC to be absolute (the path is specific to my pi now though)
 - did chmod to make ptimep executable
 - added in a entry to /etc/crontab to ping pitemp.py every hour
